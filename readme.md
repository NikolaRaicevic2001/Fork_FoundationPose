# FoundationPose: Unified 6D Pose Estimation and Tracking of Novel Objects
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08344) [[Website]](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/)

## ROS2 Port

This fork ports the ROS nodes from ROS1 (rospy) to ROS2 (rclpy),
for integration with the Object-Informed MPPI pipeline (ROS2-based).

### What changed
- `fp_ros_node.py`, `fp_evaluator_ros_node.py`, `fp_ros_utils.py`:
  ported from rospy to rclpy. Pose is now published as `PoseStamped`
  (was `Pose`) on `/object_pose`, adding a timestamp.
- Parameters are passed via ROS2 args, e.g.
  `--ros-args -p camera:=realsense -p mesh_file:=/path/to/mesh.ply`
- `visualize` is now a ROS2 parameter (default true) instead of a
  hardcoded debug level.
- Evaluator: added an optional depth-based check (`use_depth_check`,
  default false) on top of mask IoU, to catch z-axis pose errors that
  the 2D silhouette misses.

### Setup & Run (ROS2)
 
**Environment**:
- conda `my` (Python 3.11), inside the container: SAM2 + FoundationPose inference + ROS2 Humble + rclpy.
- **RealSense runs on the host** (librealsense 2.58, ROS2 Jazzy), not in the container. The container's librealsense 2.55 mismatches the D455's firmware 5.17, which throttles depth. The container subscribes to the camera topics over DDS instead. See Terminal 1 below.
#### 0. Build images (only when something changed)
 
```bash
cd ~/{workspace}/Fork_FoundationPose
 
# base image (Python 3.11, torch 2.5.1+cu121, pytorch3d, nvdiffrast)
docker build -t foundationpose -f docker/dockerfile .
 
# ROS2 + SAM2 + RealSense integration image
docker build -t ros2_sam2_foundationpose -f docker/ros2_sam2_dockerfile .
```
 
The base image takes ~20min (pytorch3d source build); the second takes a while too (RoboStack install). If only code changed, just restart the container, no rebuild needed.
 
**Post-build check** (inside the container, all 7 must pass):
```bash
conda activate my
python3 -c "import torch; print('torch', torch.__version__)"  # 2.5.1+cu121
python3 -c "from sam2 import _C; print('_C OK')"  # _C OK
python3 -c "import rclpy; print('rclpy OK')"
python3 -c "import numpy; print('numpy', numpy.__version__)"  # 1.26.4
python3 -c "import trimesh, scipy, cv2; print('fp deps OK')"
python3 -c "import nvdiffrast.torch; print('nvdiffrast OK')"
ros2 pkg list | grep realsense  # realsense2_camera
```
 
#### 1. Start the container
 
```bash
cd ~/{workspace}/Fork_FoundationPose
bash docker/run_ros2_sam2_container.sh
```
 
For additional terminals:
```bash
docker exec -it ros2_sam2_foundationpose bash
```
 
`PYTHONPATH`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are set automatically on activating `my` (via `activate.d/zzz_env.sh`) — no manual export needed.
 
#### 2. One-time: build mycpp
 
FoundationPose is mounted at runtime, not baked into the image, so the `mycpp` C++ extension must be built once inside the container (Python 3.11 → `cpython-311`). It's on the mounted path, so this build persists.
 
```bash
conda activate my
cd ~/{workspace}/Fork_FoundationPose/mycpp
rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j
# result: mycpp/build/mycpp.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
```
 
#### 3. Run the pipeline (4 terminals, all `conda activate my` unless noted)
 
**Terminal 1 — RealSense (on the host, not in the container)**
 
The container's librealsense 2.55 causes `control_transfer` spam and throttles depth to 0.2-8Hz. The host's librealsense 2.58 matches the D455 firmware and gives a clean 30Hz; the container subscribes over DDS.
 
**Deactivate conda here** — conda's Python shadows the system ROS2 Jazzy Python and causes an `rclpy._rclpy_pybind11` ImportError.
 
Namespace must be `/` and name `camera` so topics come out as `/camera/color/image_raw` (the code's expected format), not the default `/camera/camera/...`. `camera_namespace:=''` (empty string) is rejected by the launch parser — use `camera_namespace:=/`.
 
```bash
# host terminal, conda deactivated
conda deactivate
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
export CYCLONEDDS_URI=file://$HOME/cyclonedds.xml

# Make sure that you are using USB 3.0 cable for bandwidth to connect the cameras!
ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py \
    align_depth.enable:=true \
    camera_namespace:=/ \
    camera_name:=camera \
    rgb_camera.color_profile:=848x480x30 \
    depth_module.depth_profile:=848x480x30
```
 
Check (`ros2 topic hz` gives false readings due to QoS mismatch — use echo'd timestamp intervals instead; 0.033s = 30Hz):
```bash
# host terminal, same conda-deactivated + jazzy-sourced setup
ros2 topic echo /camera/color/image_raw --no-arr --field header.stamp
ros2 topic echo /camera/aligned_depth_to_color/image_raw --no-arr --field header.stamp
```
 
If `control_transfer ... Resource temporarily unavailable` warnings are **not** spamming and color/depth are at 30Hz, it's working. If they spam, it's running against the container's librealsense instead of the host's — recheck your conda/env.
 
> ⚠️ **DDS depth loss**: depth (848x480) can overflow the default DDS buffers and drop in bursts of 4 frames — this goes away once the container's `CYCLONEDDS_URI` points to a valid `cyclonedds.xml`. If `echo $CYCLONEDDS_URI` is empty in the container, depth breaks again — always check this in whichever shell launches FoundationPose (Terminal 3).
 
**Terminal 2 — SAM2**
```bash
bash docker/run_ros2_sam2_container.sh
cd /opt/sam2
python3 sam2_ros_node.py --ros-args -p camera:=realsense -p frequency:=10.0
```
Click the object once when the window appears. Once `Mask initialized` prints, the mask publishes on `/sam2_mask`.
 
Optional mask check (new terminal):
```bash
docker exec -it ros2_sam2_foundationpose bash
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view   
# Then, select /sam2_mask, /fp_render_mask, /fp_depth_residual, or /fp_debug_overlay from the dropdown
```
 
**Terminal 3 — FoundationPose**
```bash
docker exec -it ros2_sam2_foundationpose bash
cd ~/{workspace}/Fork_FoundationPose
python3 fp_ros_node.py --ros-args \
    -p camera:=realsense \
    -p mesh_file:=/path/to/object.ply  # You can find some objects' meshes in meshes directory. e.g. meshes/T_block/T_block.ply
```
`self.diameter:0.12...` in the init log confirms the mm→m mesh conversion applied (pre-conversion it reads ~120.5). Once a mask arrives, registration runs, then tracking starts and `Tracking done in NN ms` repeats.
 
**Terminal 4 — TF frame broadcast**
```bash
docker exec -it ros2_sam2_foundationpose bash
cd ~/{workspace}/Fork_FoundationPose
python3 fp_tf_broadcaster.py --ros-args \
    -p npz_path:=camera_036322250488_extrinsics.npz \
    -p robot_frame:=xarm_device \
    -p camera_frame:=fp_camera_color_optical_frame
```

**Terminal 5 — Check output (Optional)**
```bash
docker exec -it ros2_sam2_foundationpose bash
ros2 topic hz /object_pose
ros2 topic echo /object_pose
```

## TYLER DOCUMENTATION (September 8, 2024)

NOTE: The purpose of this documentation is NOT to be super precise and detailed, but rather to be a quick reference for how to run the code and how it works.

### EXAMPLE VIDEO

This is an example that demonstrates the reasonable robustness FoundationPose, with the help of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) model to initialize FoundationPose and reset FoundationPose when the object is lost. If the SAM2 mask (very accurate) is very different from the FoundationPose prediction's mask (less accurate), the tracker will reset.

This video shows FoundationPose working at ~40Hz.

### Parameters

You should set the following ROS parameters:
```
rosparam set /camera zed  # zed or realsense
rosparam set /mesh_file /path/to/mesh.obj  # Object to be tracked
```

This sets the topics to be used

```
if camera == "zed":
    self.rgb_sub_topic = "/zed/zed_node/rgb/image_rect_color"
    self.depth_sub_topic = "/zed/zed_node/depth/depth_registered"
    self.camera_info_sub_topic = "/zed/zed_node/rgb/camera_info"
elif camera == "realsense":
    self.rgb_sub_topic = "/camera/color/image_raw"
    self.depth_sub_topic = "/camera/aligned_depth_to_color/image_raw"
    self.camera_info_sub_topic = "/camera/color/camera_info"
```

### CHANGES

* Addition of `docker/ros_dockerfile` and `docker/run_ros_container.sh` to add ROS Noetic installation with Robostack (https://robostack.github.io/GettingStarted.html)

* Addition of `fp_ros_node.py`, which listens for RGB images, depth images, and mask images, then publishes poses (make sure to set the input mesh and camera intrinsics)

* Addition of `fp_evaluator_ros_node.py`, which listens for RGB images, depth images, mask images, and poses, then publishes predicted masks and a reset message if predicted mask is poor (make sure to set the input mesh and camera intrinsics)

Note that we keep the `fp_ros_node.py` as simple as possible because we need FoundationPose to run at as high a rate as possible (20-50Hz). If it runs slower than that, it will do very poorly because the tracking method only works well with small pose changes. This is achievable when running at a high rate, but severely degrades if running at a low rate (~5Hz). This is why we make a separate `fp_ros_node.py` for debugging and evaluation (to decide if it needs to reset the pose tracker). Also be careful about other things running on the GPU (e.g. mask generator).

## HOW TO RUN

### Weights

Download all network weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DFezOAD0oD1BblsXVxqDsl8fj0qzB82i?usp=sharing) and put them under the folder `weights/`. For the refiner, you will need `2023-10-28-18-33-37`. For scorer, you will need `2024-01-11-20-02-45`.

### Docker

We needed to use Docker. Using conda alone did not work, despite lots of effort.

```
# May need to add sudo to all docker commands (if not set up for your user)
cd docker/
docker build --network host -f dockerfile -t foundationpose .
docker build --network host -f ros_dockerfile -t ros_foundationpose .
cd ..

bash docker/run_ros_container.sh
```

If you have Docker permission issues, you may need to do the following:
```
# Source: https://medium.com/@praveenadoni4456/error-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket-at-e68bfab8146a
# start docker daemon
sudo systemctl start docker

# enable docker permissions
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
sudo systemctl restart docker
```


If it's the first time you launch the container, you need to build extensions from inside the container.
```
cd FoundationPose
bash build_all.sh
```

Later you can execute into the container without re-build.
```
docker exec -it ros_foundationpose bash
```

If you close the container, open again with
```
bash docker/run_ros_container.sh
```

### Run on offline data

```
docker exec -it ros_foundationpose bash
python run_demo.py
```

If you get this error:
```
ImportError: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version GLIBCXX_3.4.29' not found (required by /opt/conda/envs/my/lib/python3.9/site-packages/matplotlib/_c_internal_utils.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so)
```

Fix like so:
```
echo $CONDA_PREFIX
/opt/conda/envs/my

find $CONDA_PREFIX -name "*libstdc++.so*"
/opt/conda/envs/my/lib/libstdc++.so
/opt/conda/envs/my/lib/libstdc++.so.6
/opt/conda/envs/my/lib/libstdc++.so.6.0.33

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/conda/envs/my/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  # Replace if yours is different
```

### Run real-time pose estimation with ROS

This is a real-time example that uses 4 components:

1. RGB-D Camera
2. Real-Time SAM2 with smart prompting (initializes pose tracker and resets it if object is lost): https://github.com/tylerlum/segment-anything-2-real-time
3. FoundationPose pose tracking (pose tracking): https://github.com/tylerlum/FoundationPose/
4. FoundationPose evaluation for resetting the tracker (converts pose prediction to a predicted mask, and resets the tracker if the mask is poor compared to the SAM2 mask): https://github.com/tylerlum/FoundationPose/

First run the camera with something like:

```
roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch align_depth:=true
roslaunch zed_wrapper zed.launch
```

Check you can see the topics:
```
rostopic list  # See expected topics
```

If you are running across PCs, set the following for each terminal:
```
# Set ROS variables if running across PCs
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://bohg-ws-5.stanford.edu:11311  # Master machine
export ROS_HOSTNAME=$(hostname)  # This machine (e.g., bohg-ws-19.stanford.edu)
```

In a terminal, run the SAM2 node:
```
python sam2_ros_node.py
```

In another terminal, run the FoundationPose node:
```
docker exec -it ros_foundationpose bash

python fp_ros_node.py
```

In another terminal, run the evaluator node (requires display):
```
docker exec -it ros_foundationpose bash

# Run with visualization (requires a display)
python fp_evaluator_ros_node.py --visualize
```

If you don't have a display, you can run without visualization (need some extra setup because of underlying code):
```
docker exec -it ros_foundationpose bash

apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libosmesa6 libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx

# Run without visualization
PYOPENGL_PLATFORM=osmesa python fp_evaluator_ros_node.py
```

Sanity check that the camera is working by viewing the RGB-D images and the FoundationPose predicted mask (good to compare with the SAM2 mask):
```
rqt_image_view &
```

You can visualize debug signals /sam2_reset and /sam2_num_mask_pixels with:
```
rqt_plot
```

FoundationPose can lose the object and it struggles to recover without being reset. To do this manually, you can run `rostopic pub /fp_reset std_msgs/Int32 "data: 1"`.

# ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION

This is the official implementation of our paper to be appeared in CVPR 2024 (Highlight)

Contributors: Bowen Wen, Wei Yang, Jan Kautz, Stan Birchfield

We present FoundationPose, a unified foundation model for 6D object pose estimation and tracking, supporting both model-based and model-free setups. Our approach can be instantly applied at test-time to a novel object without fine-tuning, as long as its CAD model is given, or a small number of reference images are captured. We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin. In addition, it even achieves comparable results to instance-level methods despite the reduced assumptions.

1) [Optional] Download our large-scale training data: ["FoundationPose Dataset"](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s4pB6p4ApfWMiMjmTXOFco8dHbNXikp-?usp=sharing)

1) [Optional] Download our preprocessed reference views [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PXXCOJqHXwQTbwPwPbGDN9_vLVe0XpFS?usp=sharing) in order to run model-free few-shot version.

# Env setup option 1: docker (recommended)
  ```
  cd docker/
  docker pull wenbowen123/foundationpose && docker tag wenbowen123/foundationpose foundationpose  # Or to build from scratch: docker build --network host -t foundationpose .
  bash docker/run_container.sh
  ```


If it's the first time you launch the container, you need to build extensions.
```
bash build_all.sh
```

Later you can execute into the container without re-build.
```
docker exec -it foundationpose bash
```

# Env setup option 2: conda (experimental)

- Setup conda environment

```bash
# create conda environment
conda create -n foundationpose python=3.9

# activate conda environment
conda activate foundationpose

# Install Eigen3 3.4.0 under conda environment
conda install conda-forge::eigen=3.4.0
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:/eigen/path/under/conda"

# install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install NVDiffRast
python -m pip install --quiet --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast.git

# Kaolin (Optional, needed if running model-free setup)
python -m pip install --quiet --no-cache-dir kaolin==0.15.0 -f https://nvidia-kaolin.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/torch-2.0.0_cu118.html

# PyTorch3D
python -m pip install --quiet --no-index --no-cache-dir pytorch3d -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorch3d/packaging/wheels/py39_cu118_pyt200/download.html

# Build extensions
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pybind11/share/cmake/pybind11 bash build_all_conda.sh
```


# Run model-based demo
The paths have been set in argparse by default. If you need to change the scene, you can pass the args accordingly. By running on the demo data, you should be able to see the robot manipulating the mustard bottle. Pose estimation is conducted on the first frame, then it automatically switches to tracking mode for the rest of the video. The resulting visualizations will be saved to the `debug_dir` specified in the argparse. (Note the first time running could be slower due to online compilation)
```
python run_demo.py
```


<img src="assets/demo.jpg" width="50%">


Feel free to try on other objects (**no need to retrain**) such as driller, by changing the paths in argparse.

<img src="assets/demo_driller.jpg" width="50%">


# Run on public datasets (LINEMOD, YCB-Video)

For this you first need to download LINEMOD dataset and YCB-Video dataset.

To run model-based version on these two datasets respectively, set the paths based on where you download. The results will be saved to `debug` folder
```
python run_linemod.py --linemod_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/LINEMOD --use_reconstructed_mesh 0

python run_ycb_video.py --ycbv_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video --use_reconstructed_mesh 0
```

To run model-free few-shot version. You first need to train Neural Object Field. `ref_view_dir` is based on where you download in the above "Data prepare" section. Set the `dataset` flag to your interested dataset.
```
python bundlesdf/run_nerf.py --ref_view_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video/bowen_addon/ref_views_16 --dataset ycbv
```

Then run the similar command as the model-based version with some small modifications. Here we are using YCB-Video as example:
```
python run_ycb_video.py --ycbv_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video --use_reconstructed_mesh 1 --ref_view_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video/bowen_addon/ref_views_16
```

# Notes
Due to the legal restrictions of Stable-Diffusion that is trained on LAION dataset, we are not able to release the diffusion-based texture augmented data, nor the pretrained weights using it. We thus release the version without training on diffusion-augmented data. Slight performance degradation is expected.

# Acknowledgement

We would like to thank Jeff Smith for helping with the code release; NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Omniverse team for the support on synthetic data generation; Tianshi Cao for the valuable discussions. Finally, we are also grateful for the positive feebacks and constructive suggestions brought up by reviewers and AC at CVPR.
